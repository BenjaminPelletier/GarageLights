* Interpolation prior to first keyframe
	* Add new keyframe before first one in example
	* Display interpolates from 0, but device snaps from 0 at keyframe
* Strictly-type DMX address and channel value
* Separate controllers into definitions and implementations
* UI allowing user to choose alternate controller implementations if one specified in project cannot be used
* UI allowing ChannelInputDevice to be selected
* Parse DMX reader serial lines manually and drop earlier lines when multiple lines are available at a time
* Add UI-less project manipulator and invoke it to make project changes
* Make KeyframeControl audio position orange when it's on a keyframe
* Pan KeyframeControl with middle mouse button
* Make IChannelSelector independent of ChannelTreeView (ChannelTreeView actuates IChannelSelector)
* Warn user if attempting to write or record with no channels selected
* Survive @ messages from Arduino
* Select keyframe at time 0 when go-to-beginning is clicked
* Support left-click-drag and scroll wheel on KeyframeControl
* Handle Delete button from value editor dialog
* Add uncheck all button
* In value dialog, change style combobox to radio buttons
