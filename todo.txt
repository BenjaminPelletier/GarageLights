* Interpolation prior to first keyframe
	* Add new keyframe before first one in example
	* Display interpolates from 0, but device snaps from 0 at keyframe
* Strictly-type DMX address and channel value
* Separate controllers into definitions and implementations
* UI allowing user to choose alternate controller implementations if one specified in project cannot be used
* Default ChannelInputDevice dialog to currently-selected device
* Simulator form to preview real-time channel values
* Parse DMX reader serial lines manually and drop earlier lines when multiple lines are available at a time
* Pan KeyframeControl with middle mouse button
* Survive @ messages from Arduino
* Support scroll wheel on KeyframeControl
* Add uncheck all button
* Move time view change (audio view) management into ShowNavigator to abstract out of KeyframeControl and AudioControl
* Remember window layout in settings
